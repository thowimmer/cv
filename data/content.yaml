Profile: I'm a software simplicity nerd who is passionate about software design, distributed systems, security & privacy. I consider myself a technology generalist rather than a specialist because, in my opinion, every technology is just another tool for a modern software engineer. I'm a team player, listener & communicator willing to take on responsibility. I have a strong background in the payment industry, where I collaborated with banks & card issuers in Europe to bring innovative mobile payment/wallet solutions into your pocket.
